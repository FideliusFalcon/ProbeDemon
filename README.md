ProbeDemon is using the scapy libary to capture probe requests and logging it to a SQL database. You need a WiFi NIC in monitor mode for it to work. ProbeDemon can work alone by parsing arguments to it or you can use it as libary. It has a TFTP client, which can send your database to a TFTP server when there is a new entry.
